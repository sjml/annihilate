_[Annihilation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2798920/)_ is a really good movie. You should watch it. 

[This site](https://shaneliesegang.com/annihilate/) will play [the noise](https://slate.com/culture/2018/02/annihilation-co-composer-ben-salisbury-explains-the-musical-cue-from-the-alien.html) at random intervals. Just leave the tab open and go about your day. You can set the upper and lower bounds of how often it will happen. No, you can’t see how long until the next one. No, you can’t stop it. (You can close the tab or reload the page, though.)
